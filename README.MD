# Note Squirrel

## Introduction
I made this project while learning Android SDK. This is a Note storing application with image based security login. For Image based login, user needs to click on specific points to unlock. Multiple notes can be stored in the application.

I referred John Purcell's training sessions from caveofprogramming.com for learning Android(big fan of his tutorials).
