Hi,

I made this project while learning Android SDK. This is a Note storing application with image based security login. For Image based login, user needs to click on specific points to unlock. Multiple notes can be stored in the application.

I referred John Purcell's training sessions from caveofprogramming.com for learning Android(big fan of his tutorials).

Check out screenshots of my application in screenshots folder.
Image 1: Create Login passpoints popup.
Image 2: Touch any 4 points.
Image 3: Add Note. Provide a name for the note.
Image 4: Main screen with all the notes.
Image 5: Particular note saved.
Image 6: Change login screen image popup.
